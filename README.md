# Kentucky Economic Dashboard (R + APIs + Tableau)
Understanding Kentucky’s economy can be challenging due to fragmented and inconsistent data sources. This R project addresses that by pulling reliable, up-to-date economic and demographic data from multiple federal sources via APIs, including:

•	Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

•	Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

•	United States Census Bureau

•	Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

# Project Overview
This code automates the collection, cleaning, and structuring of key economic indicators for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and its 120 counties. The cleaned data is formatted for seamless integration into Tableau, where it's visualized through a cohesive, interactive dashboard aimed at informing policymakers, analysts, and the public.

Measures Included:

•	Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth

•	High school graduate or higher attainment rate

•	Median household income

•	Poverty rate

•	Unemployment rate

•	5-year employment change

•	10-year population change

# Why APIs?
By using APIs, this project ensures that both the code and the Tableau dashboard remain easily updatable as new data is released. This makes it a dynamic and sustainable tool for staying informed on Kentucky’s economic health over time.
